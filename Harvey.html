    <h1>Reading 3- Harvey response</h1>
    <p> It was very inspiring reading how Harvey's connection with the web grew as she grew. I love how she included the little details throughout her interview like her at a certain point not liking computers simply because "computers were for boys" which happened to be very ironic. She also talks about her secret love letters through the web which I am very interested in on how that came about. Her career, her love life, everything she loves happened because of and through the web and she gets to see how much it advances as technology advances.
