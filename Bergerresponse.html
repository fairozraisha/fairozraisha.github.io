    <h1>Reading 2- Berger response</h1>
    <p>Without any context, a painting or a picture is a still image with silence (as Berger states) and we can't help but come up with the deeper meaning behind it. Berger makes it clear that the way we see these images are influenced by what's around us. He also talks about how a painting loses its worth over time because of copies. This leads to the painting being manipulative because then the true intentions of the original painting becomes overlooked. I find this to be very interesting because as technology advances, we tend to lose the roots. We now see copies of famous paintings and arts that can be created in seconds with the power of technology.
